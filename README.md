# Lab: Django Models



## Overview

Django has a powerful Object Relational Mapper that allows us to persist data using Python instead of SQL.

Today you’ll build out a project with one model and wire up that model using Django Views.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- create **blog_project** project
- create **blog** app
- migrate data
  - create **Post** model
  - add **title** as a CharField with maximum length of 64 characters.
  - add **author** ForeignKey related to Django’s built in user model with CASCADE delete option.
  - add **body** TextField
- add model to admin
- modify **Post** model have user friendly display in admin
- create migrations and migrate data
- create a super user
- Add a few posts via Admin panel
- Add **templates** folder in root of project
  - register **templates** folder in project settings
- create **HomePageView**
  - extend **ListView**
  - give a template of **home.html**
  - associate **Post** model
- create h**ome.html** template
  - use **Django Templating Language** to display each post’s title
- create **base.html** ancestor template
  - add main html document
  - use **Django Templating Language** to allow child templates to insert content
- update url patterns for app and project
- view home page and confirm posts showing properly
- add detail view
  - link **post_detail.html** template
  - associate **Post** model
- create **post_detail.html** template
  - template should extend base
  - content should display post title and body
- update app urlpatterns to handle detail view
  - account for primary key in url
- add link in home page template to related post detail page

## Implementation Notes

- The instructions are becoming more conceptual.
- All the concepts listed relate to key Django steps covered in the demo.
- If there is confusion about what, exactly, is required then ask the client (aka the instructors.)
- TLDR - make your lab project like the demo project.

## User Acceptance Tests

- Test **HomePageViewTest**
  - verify status code
  - verify correct template use
  - use url name instead of hard coded path
- We can’t test **PostDetailView** until next class.
  - Can you figure out why?

## Configuration

- Create django-models GitHub repository.
- Use poetry to manage virtual environment and dependencies.
